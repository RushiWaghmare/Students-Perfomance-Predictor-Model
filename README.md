# Students-Perfomance-Predictor-Model

# 📚 Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning 🎓

## Overview
This project aims to predict student performance based on various academic and demographic factors using machine learning techniques. The analysis utilizes a dataset stored in an Excel file and applies several algorithms to uncover insights that could support educational strategies. 🌟✨

## Dataset 📊
The dataset is provided in an Excel (.csv) file named `Student_performance_data.csv` and contains the following features:

- **Demographics**:
  - 👶 Age
  - 🚻 Gender
  - 🌍 Ethnicity
  - 🎓 Parental Education

- **Academic Factors**:
  - 📖 Study Time Weekly
  - ❌ Absences
  - 📈 GPA
  - 📚 Grade Class

- **Extracurriculars**:
  - ⚽ Sports
  - 🎶 Music
  - 🙋‍♀️ Volunteering
  - 👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Support

Ensure the Excel file is placed in the project folder, and the script will automatically load it for analysis. 🔍
